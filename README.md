**Showcase**
=============
Samples of avocational projects and scripts. Currently, most of the Python scripts are for API data extraction. I'll add more analyses in the future.

Contain python scripts to pull datasets
* **Movement Detection:** As part of the Coursera Machine Learning course, I created a Quadratic Discriminant Analysis model to classify movements from body sensors. The markup file (Movement Detection (Coursera).md) and associated R code (movement-detection.R) can be found in this folder.
* **yelp_neighborhood.py:** pulls all food establishments for a given neighborhood (e.g. 'Fort Greene, Brooklyn'). Outputs a pandas data frame, which will be used for additional analysis later.
* **nyc_open_business_lookup.py:** pulls all businesses within a given zip code.
