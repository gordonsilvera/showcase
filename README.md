* **Movement Detection.** As part of the Coursera Machine Learning course, I created a Quadratic Discriminant Analysis model to classify movements from body sensors. The markup file (Movement Detection (Coursera).md) and associated R code (movement-detection.R) can be found in this folder.
* **yelp_neighborhood.py.** Pulls all food establishments for a given neighborhood (e.g. 'Fort Greene, Brooklyn'). Outputs a pandas data frame, which will be used for additional analysis later.
* **nyc_open_business_lookup.py.** Pulls all businesses within a given zip code. 
* **Coursera - Regressions_Final Project.pdf.** Developed GLM models to predict cars' mileage (MPG) based on a variety of factors. This was written in R and completed during the Coursera Regressions course.
* **Coursera - Movement Detection.md.** Analyzed movement sensor data (similar to FitBit) to predict how a subject was completing a bicep curl (e.g. according to specification, lowering the dumbell halfway, throwing elbows to the front). I tested various models and settled on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, a type of classification model. **movement-detection.R** is the script I used to complete the analysis.
